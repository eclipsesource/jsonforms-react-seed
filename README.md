This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
# JSON Forms React seed App
This seed demonstrates how to use [JSON Forms](https://jsonforms.io) with React 
in order to render a simple form for displaying a task entity.
 
It is based on create-react-app and only contains minor modifications.

 * Execute `npm install` to install the prerequisites.
 * Execute `npm start` to start the application.

## File Structure
Let's briefly have a look at the most important files:
* `src/schema.json` contains the JSON schema (also referred to as 'data schema')
* `src/uischema.json` contains the UI schema
* `src/index.js` is the entry point of the application and sets up the redux store 
  that contains the data, the JSON and the UI schema necessary for JSON Forms.
* `src/App.js` is the main React component and makes use of the JSON Forms Component
  in order to render a form.
  
The [data schema](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-react-seed/blob/master/src/schema.json) defines   
the structure of a Task: it contains attributes such as title, description, due date and so on.

The [corresponding UI schema](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-react-seed/blob/master/src/uischema.json) 
specifies controls for each property and puts them into a vertical layout that in turn contains two
horizontal layouts.

Both the data schema and the UI schema are imported within `index.js` and are used
to set up a redux store. We make use of a helper function exported by JSON Forms
which expects the initial state. If you already have an existing redux store, 
you'll need to import the jsonforms reducer and add it to your store. 
Please refer to TODO for how to do this.

## Setting up the store

```js
const store = createStore(
  jsonformsReducer(),
  {
    jsonforms: {
      common: {
        data,
        schema,
        uischema
      },
      renderers: JsonForms.renderers,
      fields: JsonForms.fields
    },
  },
  applyMiddleware(thunk)
);

// initialize store
store.dispatch({
  type: Actions.INIT,
  data,
  schema,
  uischema,
});

// trigger initial validation
store.dispatch(Actions.validate());
```

We then use the `Provider` component provided by `react-redux` to provide the store to the 
`App` component and all its children.

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
); 
```

## Rendering our form
The `App` component is responsible for rendering our actual form.
It does so by importing and using `DispatchRenderer` from `@jsonforms/core`.
`DispatchRenderer` expects `schema` and `uischema` props which define 
the form to be rendered but if those are omitted, they will be pulled from the 
store which was provided via `Provider` previously.

Since we also like to display the actual data that is being edited we 
`connect` the `App` component to the store in order to extract the data 
from it. 

## Custom renderers
Please see our corresponding tutorial (TODO) on how to add custom renderers.
